 # :sparkles:Flashing LED Program:sparkles:
## Program \#2 , Anna Jackson 06/12/17
This was a very interesting and fun program for me to create. I learned how to make the LED:rotating_light: flash at different speeds and how to program 2 LEDS:rotating_light: to do things at the same time.
### :arrow_down:The Process:arrow_down:
* Place a wire in a pin, place the other end in the breadboard in the same row.
* Place the + end of the LED:rotating_light: (the long end) into the same row as this wire.
* Place the - end of the LED:rotating_light: into another place on the breadboard.
* Place a second wire in the same row as the - end of the LED:rotating_light:
* Place the end of that wire in ground and run the program!
